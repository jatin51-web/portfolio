# Profile Image Optimization Tips

## To make your face more visible in the profile image:

### 1. **Image Positioning**
- The CSS is set to `object-position: center top` to focus on the upper portion of the image
- This ensures your face is centered and visible

### 2. **Image Enhancement**
- Added brightness and contrast filters to make your face more prominent
- `filter: brightness(1.1) contrast(1.1)` enhances visibility

### 3. **Recommended Image Specifications**
- **Size**: 300x300 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio)
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Content**: Face should be in the upper 60% of the image
- **Lighting**: Well-lit face with good contrast

### 4. **If you need to replace the image:**
1. Save your new image as `jat.jpg` in the `public` folder
2. Make sure your face is clearly visible and centered
3. The image will automatically update on the website

### 5. **Current Image Adjustments Applied:**
- ✅ Centered positioning (`center top`)
- ✅ Enhanced brightness and contrast
- ✅ Proper circular cropping
- ✅ Orange border for professional look
- ✅ Responsive sizing for all devices

The image should now display your face more prominently!
